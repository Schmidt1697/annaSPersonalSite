      A bit about me. . . 
      </p>
      <p>
      I'm a fullstack software engineer. I discovered the wild world of coding almost two years ago. My unconventional path to software development started while working as a critical-care nurse. I love to help others, and have a lot of hands-on experience doing so. In my spare time, I completed multiple online courses (mostly through Udemy), reading books on basic html, css, and javascript and building small projects. I learned my side-interest was actually something I wanted to pursue full-time. I'm in awe of the infinite possibilities this career field allows in terms of collaborating and creating programs that have the potential to reach and help numerous people. I work best when fully-immersed in the content I'm working to absorb. I'll complete a fullstack software engineering bootcamp in December 2022.

      Aside from work, I LOVE being outside! I'm fortunate to call Colorado my home. High alpine lakes, technical ridglines, and running many miles on trails overgrown with wildflowers are a few of my favorite things.
